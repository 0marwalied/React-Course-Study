# JavaScript Promises Notes

Synchronous programming is blocking.

Asynchronous programming is non-blocking.
In synchronous programming, tasks are performed one at a time.

In asynchronous programming, tasks can be performed concurrently.

Callbacks, Promises, and async/await are common patterns in asynchronous programming.

Callback hell is a problem where callbacks are nested within callbacks, making code hard to read and maintain.
